1. User Registration & Initial Setup
As a user, I want to register an account and automatically create a monthly budget record,
so that I can start managing my finances right after signing up.

2. Goal Tracking
As a user, I want to set a financial goal (e.g., buying a car), track my savings toward it,
and see progress updates, so that I can plan large purchases confidently.

3. Income Management
As a user, I want to add income entries from different sources (e.g., salary, freelance),
update or delete them, and have these changes reflected in my dashboard and goals,
so that I can manage earnings accurately.

4. Expense Management & Categorization
As a user, I want to add, update, or delete expense entries and assign them
to custom categories (e.g., Travel, Groceries), so that I can track and organize
my spending effectively.

5. Financial History Search
As a user, I want to view my income and expense history filtered by date range
or category, so that I can analyze my past financial habits and trends.

6. Real-Time Financial Dashboard
As a user, I want to view a real-time dashboard that shows my current balance, total income, total expenses, goal progress, and a category-wise breakdown of expenses, so that I can understand my financial health at a glance.

7. Admin Cleanup Action
As an admin, I want to delete a user and automatically remove all their associated records (expenses, incomes, budget, goals, and categories), so that the system stays clean and consistent.
